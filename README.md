Helping people to tell Wayfair to tell other people how many blue couches they could buy at a time, by building APIs, Websites, and Integrations.

Also, oddly, learning basic German in order to draft [a gigantic user guide](https://github.com/wayfair-contribs/plentymarkets-plugin/blob/main/meta/documents/user_guide_de.md).

### Pegasystems

(Re)Writing all of the integration backend code, so you don't have to write any code at all.

- Coaching Directors, Product Managers, Support Engineers and End-Users on internet technologies and the use of Pega's integration feature set.
  - I gave semi-annual presentations on "what are secure sockets and what versions of TLS should we be supporting (and deprecating) next?"
  - See my efforts to help users report and resolve bugs:
    - [official Pega support forums - login required](https://support.pega.com/user/1221491/community_activity/replies)
    - [public results via google](https://www.google.com/search?q=pega+houlj)
- Finding novel ways to fix clients' odd, emergency issues
  - I cobbled together a Server Name Indication (SNI) implementation for old versions of Apache libraries, so that customers could hot patch their systems instead of updating their Java version to support the libraries that came with SNI built in, and they could start using Google services again.
- Adding and enhancing data channels in the Pega platform
  - I made it possible for your banks and insurance companies to send you emails with embedded images (sorry?).
  - I authored the first properly-encoded Tweet coming from a Pega flow.
- Componentizing modules in a monolithic Java codebase
  - I abstracted and reimplemented a lot of the code and PegaRules middleware in order to actually work across all supported operating systems and application servers.
  - I assisted in migrating my team to a Test-Driven-Development approach with reusable, testable code.
- Designed, implemented, and ran real end-to-end testing of integration features via emulation of customers' applications and environments based on donated samples.
  - I asked a lot of third parties to fix their broken REST services for everyone's sake.
- Adding new Integration Security features to the Pega platform.
  - I got the Pega platform to start utilzing the complicated layers of security in IBM Websphere instead of being overly tuned to Apache Tomcat.
  - Your insurance company started transferring your private information by more secure means after I was there for a while.
  - I manually backported some Transport Layer Security (TLS) features to ancient versions of Apache HTTP Client, for customers who could not upgrade Java but still wanted to use Google services.

### UNH IOL
